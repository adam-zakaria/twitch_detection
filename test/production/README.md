Run twitch in prod...

Run http server and observe the logs.

okay...run http server on which port..1337? 
backend
1337
front
1338

Okay so we have the log server running, let's go to 1338 and observe logs? start twitch detections?

add prints for uploading (pain because it's in the func, maybe add flag to go to log server?....might be a reason to not do prints in the func...let the parent handle logging)

Done...now confirm uploads get logged then start on gpu spawn
