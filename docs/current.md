Testing 
/home/ubuntu/Code/twitch_detection/test/misc/download_and_process.py
with streams that we will rsync from local to gpu so we can test pipeline with actual detections. So far, we know the pipeline works in prod when streams are downloaded and no dks (because we tested with downloads of only 10s)
