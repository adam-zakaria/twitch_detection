# Current
* Need to re-add log to utils.py, no idea where it went and how utils.log still works in gpu_process.py
* check the run: ideally detect can be seen for each video path and ideally dks are detected and the pipeline is run, then a longer run can be done. GPU will run out of space with longer runs though.
